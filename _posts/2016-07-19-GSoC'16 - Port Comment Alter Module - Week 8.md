categories:

As part of GSoC'16 I'm working on **Porting Comment Alter module to Drupal 8** under the mentorship of [boobaa][] and [czigor][]. This blog is an excerpt of the work which I did in the ninth week of the coding period of GSoC'16. The blogpost for the work done in the eighth week can be found [here][previous_blog].

So by the end of the week I completed the function assertCommentDiff() and tested in for text fields. My mentors have already reviewed the code for the work which I did during this week. If anyone is interested, my progress can be followed in my [GitHub repo][github_repo].
