**Community Bonding Period**
some modules which covered the basics of Form API. We used Acquia Cloud as our hosting solution where our work can be seen ([Link to the page](http://anchal298pygasvddu.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/)). I also went through a few issues related to the module and provided patch for it.
Since the coding period has started now, the next blog will be on my progress over the first week of coding.
